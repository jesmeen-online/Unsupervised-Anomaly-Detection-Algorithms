# Data Analysis and Visualization with Random Forest

This repository contains a Python script for analyzing and visualizing the accuracy of a Random Forest model on different subsets of data. The script reads data from a CSV file, preprocesses it, trains a Random Forest model, and plots the accuracy of the model as a function of the dataset size.
